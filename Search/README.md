# Welcome to PacMan-solves-a-maze Project

#### About

This is a fun project in my artificial intelligence course. The goal is to use search algorithms
to help PacMan find the path through a maze. The path is something like "East, South, South, West, South". 
The problem input is a graph. Search algorithms used:
- Depth first search: search the deepest nodes first
- Breath first search: search the shallowest nodes first
- Uniform cost search: search with path cost 
- A* search: search with heuristic and path cost

#### To run

Just clone this repository. You will need Python installed.

#### Credits

Special thanks to my Professor Sakpal for helping me with implementations of the algorithms.
