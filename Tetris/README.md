This is a fun project I completed in TCSS 305 at UW - Tacoma. The graphical user interface
was the only thing I did, the game model was provided.

  - Various classes for the game board, block, and pieces.
- View
  - Included a main class which creates a GUI with various components implemented by the other 6 classes.

#### How to play the game:
- Clone this repository.
- The Tetris.jar file is all you need. Just double-click it and enjoy.
