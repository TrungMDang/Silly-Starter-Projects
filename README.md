#### About

This is a repository for selected projects I've completed or participated in college.

Before I uploaded them here, I imported them to [IntelliJ] (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
and I made some changes to ensure they would run with the new IDE (the original IDE was [Eclipse]
(https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/eclipse-packages/)). Some projects also have runnable JAR files.
